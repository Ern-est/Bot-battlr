Welcome to galactic web app, where all robots including your own choice is found! View the robot's list, details, and select your favorite! 
## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
## Instructions
Run npm install in your terminal.
Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 8002.
In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 8000.
## Endpoints
The base url for your backend is;
`http://localhost:3000/bots`
